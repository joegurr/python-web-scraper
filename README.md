# Python Book Scraper

This is a tiny project I am using to learn python!

I am using pipenv to manage my dependencies.

I am logging to a file called logs.txt that is not being version controlled.

The logging is exaggerated, I would likely not log this way in a production deployment, I am just learning the tool.

This project is my interpretation and extension of an example in the [The Complete Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-python-course/).
